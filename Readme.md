# Version Class and Test Program

The file `src/version/Version.java` contains the `Version` class that stores a version
(usually a software version) as a sequence of integers.

The file `src/version/VersionTest.java` contains a program that tests the `Version`
class by creating `Version` objects and comparing them using the `Version` class's `compareTo` method. It also
sorts a list of `Version` objects.
